Fundamentals of Programming
===========================

Prerequisites
-------------

This is a first course in programming, so there are no prerequisites.

Study Material
--------------

Books
"""""

Currently, there are no highly recommended books that effectively teach modern C++.

Online Resources
""""""""""""""""

#. `Learn CPP <https://www.learncpp.com/>`_

   This website, `www.learncpp.com <https://www.learncpp.com/>`_, offers comprehensive lessons on programming and modern C++. It's regularly updated, highly recommended by many developers, and superior to studying from a book due to its frequent updates.

#. Coding Challenge Platforms

   There are multiple websites that can help sharpen your programming skills. You can choose any platform you prefer, but the ones I favor and recommend are: 
     
   - `HackerRank <https://www.hackerrank.com/>`_
   - `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/>`_
   - `Exercism <https://exercism.org/>`_

Summary
--------

The suggested online resources alone should be more than sufficient for learning the Fundamentals of Programming. If I come across excellent books on C++ programming later, I might add them.
