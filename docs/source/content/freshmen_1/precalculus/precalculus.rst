#. "Algebra and Trigonometry 4th Edition by James Stewart, Lothar Redlin, Saleem Watson"

This book serve as valuable reference materials. Given that it encompass fundamental concepts, when it comes to the exercises in the
books, I suggest doing the odd numbered problems since they have solution manual you can get from the internet.
Attempting to complete all exercises (odd and even) is not recommended since it might demand an excessive amount of time.

Summary
-------

This book will serve as sufficient resources to refresh your mathematical skills and acquire the necessary knowledge before delving into Calculus
and advanced mathematics. The recommended book is taught at the college level during the freshman year,
aimed at preparing students who need to refresh their math skills for more advanced studies in mathematics.
