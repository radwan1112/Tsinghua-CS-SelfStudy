1. "Computer Science: An Overview, 13th edition" by J. Glenn Brookshear and Dennis Brylow.

   This book consists of 13 chapters. Ideally, you should aim to complete it within 15-30 days, but it could take longer if you decide to solve all the book's problems. The book covers many topics in computer science to prepare you for what's to come. This book is also used by Tsinghua University in the Introduction to Computer Science course.

Summary
-------

The book alone should be sufficient, but you can also refer to `THU-CST-Cracker <https://rekcarc-tsc-uht.readthedocs.io/>`_ for additional materials such as past exam papers, syllabus, and more.
