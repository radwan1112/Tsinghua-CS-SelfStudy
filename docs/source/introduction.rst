Introduction
============

Welcome to this Self Study Guide which is based on Tsinghua University curriculum for the computer science \& technology undergraduate program! Here's how this guide empowers your learning journey:

**Guided by Tsinghua:** We align with Tsinghua University's curriculum, ensuring comprehensive coverage of essential topics.

**Enrichment from REKCARC-TSC-UHT:** This project supplements our guide with additional course material, including homework, books, and exams.

**A Self-Study Roadmap:** This documentation serves as your roadmap to mastering computer science. It offers suggestions for books, online courses, and materials to help you gain the required knowledge in each subject.

Study Objective
---------------

The computer science program aims to provide comprehensive professional education that integrates multiple disciplines and is based on a foundation of general education. The program aims to construct a curriculum system that encompasses a wide range of basic courses with common professional characteristics, as well as a core curriculum system with specific expertise. The emphasis is on providing students with fundamental theories, foundational knowledge, essential skills, and fostering a well-rounded personality, holistic qualities, and an innovative spirit.

The goal is to cultivate versatile individuals with a solid foundation, broad expertise, and the ability for independent learning. Graduates should possess lofty scientific aspirations and life ideals. The program aims to nurture a group of high-caliber graduates with the potential to become "academic masters" who lead trends in the field of computer science, or "industry leaders" who make significant impact in the business world.

Requirments
-----------

Computer Science and Technology Graduates should possess the following knowledge and abilities:

a. Ability to apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering knowledge
b. Ability to design and conduct experiments, analyze and interpret data
c. Ability to design systems, devices, or processes that meet desired requirements while considering real constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health, safety, ease of processing, and sustainability
d. Ability to work in multidisciplinary teams
e. Ability to identify, propose, and solve engineering problems
f. Understanding of professional ethics and responsibilities in the field of study
g. Ability for effective communication
h. Possess a broad knowledge base, capable of recognizing the global, economic, environmental, and societal impact of engineering solutions
i. Recognize the importance of lifelong learning and have the ability to improve oneself through continuous learning
j. Possess knowledge to understand contemporary social and technological issues from a professional perspective
k. Ability to apply technology, skills, and modern engineering tools for engineering practice

Duration and Degree Conferment
------------------------------

The undergraduate program for Computer Science and Technology has a duration of four years. Upon completion, graduates are conferred with a Bachelor of Engineering degree.
The curriculum and credit distribution are designed in accordance with the undergraduate program's duration. The maximum period for undergraduate study is the program duration plus an additional two years.

Basic Credit Requirements
-------------------------

The total credit requirement for undergraduate education is 160 credits. This includes 46 credits for university-level
general education courses, 95 credits for major-related courses, and 19 credits for practical components of the major.

**Note:** Subjects that are not related to computer science well not be included

Curriculum Setting and Credit Distribution
------------------------------------------

As stated earlier only subjects related to computer science \& IT well be included

#. **Foundational courses 39 credits compulsory**

The fundamental courses are the compulsory courses and credit requirements set by the Computer Science Department for students in this major, 
covering mathematics and natural science foundations, subject foundations, practical components, and other aspects. These courses and components 
provide students with the essential theories, knowledge, scientific methods, basic skills,
and abilities necessary for in-depth learning and research in the field of computer science and technology.
